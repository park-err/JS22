            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to consider me. 
                I am looking to find a place to continue my career in 
                tech and think that we would be a great fit.
            </p>

                Technology is a great passion of mine. 
                I spend my free-time learning about new technologies, 
                coding new projects, and reading documentations for 
                different coding languages. While interning at the 
                Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, I expanded on my knowledge 
                about networks and cybersecurity. I also learned how to 
                automate processes with PowerShell and Bash and how to handle 
                tickets submitted by users. 
            </p>

                To me, tech support is about connecting with the user and 
                ensuring they get the most out of the machine intended to 
                help them. I strive to fix issues, keep machines running, 
                and personalize them to the user's experience. As a worker, 
                I always have a task that I am working on. I am well-adjusted 
                to a fast-paced work environment and multitask easily.
